# Sunghyun's NixOS

## Quick Install

On a fresh NixOS installation:

```sh
nix-shell -p curl --run 'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anaclumos/nix/main/bootstrap.sh | sh'
```

## macOS Key Controls

- Command, Option, Control follows macOS Key Controls.
- Command+Backspace deletes whole line, Option+Backspace deletes a word, etc.
- Command+Space opens GNOME Overview, similar to Spotlight

## Hyper Key

- Caps Lock is Hyper Key
- Hyper Key alone maximizes the window.
- Hyper Key combined with several alphabets are mapped to opening or focusing windows.
- For example, Hyper + J opens or focuses Chrome.

## Language Switching inspired from Kana Keys

- Left Command clicked alone always switches to English.
- Right Alt clicked alone always switches to Korean.
